# **Air Pollution Quality Monitoring and Prediction System**

## **Overview**

This project is an IoT-based solution for monitoring, analyzing, and predicting air quality. Using sensors and LoRa modules, real-time pollution data is collected, transmitted to a central node, and uploaded to the cloud for detailed analysis and visualization. The system provides actionable insights to help improve environmental awareness and decision-making.

## **Features**

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Collect live air quality data, including PM2.5, CO2 levels, and more.
- **Location Pinpoint**: Track pollution levels for specific geographical locations.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Predict future air quality trends using advanced models.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize data through charts, graphs, and heat maps.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up notifications for critical air quality levels.
- **Cloud Integration**: Store and access data securely on the cloud.

## **Technologies Used**

- **IoT Hardware**: Sensors (e.g., PM2.5, CO2), LoRa modules, ESP32 microcontrollers.
- **Backend**: Python, Node.js for data processing and API development.
- **Frontend**: React.js or similar for interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Cloud**: AWS, Firebase, or similar for data storage and analytics.
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive models for air quality forecasting.
